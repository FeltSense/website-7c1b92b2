Create a modern, enterprise-grade **editorial website** for a game development studio called **IMS Games**.

- Dark or neutral base with restrained accent colors
- High-quality imagery, abstract visuals, game stills, and studio shots
- Smooth, subtle animations (fade, parallax, reveal on scroll)

Site structure:
- **Home**: Editorial hero with a strong statement about IMS Games, latest highlights, featured projects
- **Studio**: Vision, philosophy, culture, and leadership
- **Games / Projects**: Case-study style pages with deep dives into games, technology, and creative process
- **Insights**: Articles, dev logs, studio updates, and thought leadership (editorial content)
- **Careers**: Studio culture, roles, growth, and talent philosophy
- **Contact**: Professional, direct, enterprise-oriented

Content approach:
- Long-form editorial sections mixed with short highlights
- Case-study storytelling (problem → process → outcome)
- Clear emphasis on craft, technology, and innovation
- Copy should feel written by a serious game studio, not marketing fluff

Technical expectations:
- Fast, polished, production-ready website

- Modern web stack (clean, scalable architecture)
- CMS-ready for ongoing editorial publishing

Overall impression:
IMS Games should come across as a **serious, modern game development studio** with strong creative identity, technical excellence, and an editorial voice that positions it as a leader in the industry.
